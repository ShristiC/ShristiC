## Fun Fact âš¡
I have visited and/or lived in 13 countries and am fluent in 3 languages!

## Who Am I? ðŸ˜„
I am a Sophomore at the University of Texas At Austin where I am double majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics, along with a minor in Disability Studies.

My interests lie in the fields of Full-Stack Web and Mobile Application Development, Natural Language Processing, and the integration of Artificial Intelligence to help connect people and strengthen cultural experiences. This past summer I interned for Srijan Technologies developing a News App. I additionally taught Python and Java to students in middle school and high school through Juni Learning. 

Though I am a developer, I am also an artist, music lover, and a compassionate individual. Often you can find me making hand-made cards, listening to diverse forms of music both in genre and language, and additionally offering a helping hand to another whenever I can.
