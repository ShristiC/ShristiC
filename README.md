## Fun Fact âš¡
So let's change it up a little. Before I go on my About Me, a fun fact is that I have been to 13 countries, lived in 5, and speak 3 languages!

## Who Am I? ðŸ˜„
I am an incoming Sophomore at the University of Texas At Austin where I am majoring in Computer Science and double minoring in Disabilities and Business. 

My interests lie in the fields of Full-Stack Web and Mobile Application Development, Natural Language Processing, and the integration of Artificial Intelligence to help connect people and strengthen cultural experiences. This past summer I interned for Srijan Technologies developing a News App. I additionally taught Python and Java to students in middle school and high school through Juni Learning. 

Though I am a developer, I am also an artist, music lover, and a compassionate individual. Often you can find me making hand-made cards, listening to diverse forms of music both in genre and language, and additionally offering a helping hand to another whenever I can. 

## I am Currently Working On... ðŸ”­
getting an introductory experience with Machine Learning and NLP. Hoping to work on a small project to get the idea. I am also in the process of launching an app I made with a friend to the Google Play Store to help field workers in India perform data retrieval. 

I am additionally taking Machine Learning, and Leadership and Emotional Intelligence courses through Coursera. 

## I would love to collaborate and get help on... ðŸ‘¯
Anything and Everything related to disabilities and tech, linguistic analysis and technological integrations within cultural spheres of interaction! I am very new to NLP and ML, thus I would love to hear about your experience, your advice, and your interests.
