## Fun Fact âš¡
So let's change it up a little. Before I go on my About Me, a fun fact is that I have been to 13 countries, lived in 5, and speak 3 languages!

## Who Am I? ðŸ˜„
I am an incoming Sophomore at the University of Texas At Austin where I am majoring in Computer Science and double minoring in Disabilities and Business. I am a corporate organizer for Freetail Hackers and am currently in the process looking for University Company Recruiters to discuss possible sponsorship and/or engagement options for our annual 24 hour hack-a-thon - HackTX (largest student run hackathon in Texas).

My interests lie in the fields of Web and Mobile Application Development, Natural Language Processing, and the integration of Artificial Intelligence to help connect people and strengthen cultural experiences. This past summer I interned for Srijan Technologies where I single handedly developed a News App. I additionally taught Python and Java to students in middle school and high school through Juni Learning. 

Though I am a developer, I am also an artist, music lover, and a compassionate individual. Often you can find me making hand-made cards, listening to diverse forms of music both in genre and language, and additionally offering a helping hand to another whenever I can. 

## I am Currently Working On... ðŸ”­
an app along with my friend, to be used in Kashi by field workers to help provide food and resources to the villagers who have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The app includes features such as having an input form, saving the responses to a database, and having a user authentication for the login. 

I am also currently taking Machine Learning by Standford University Professor Andrew Ng and Leadership and Emotional Intelligence through the Indian School of Business. 

## I would love to collaborate and get help on... ðŸ‘¯
Anything and Everything related to disabilities and tech, linguistic analysis and technological integrations within cultural spheres of interaction! I am very new to NLP and ML, thus I would love to hear about your experience, your advice, and your interests.
