## Who Am I? ðŸ˜„
I am a full-stack software engineer. I work in the Assistive Technology, Accessibility, and Disability Tech Space. I am passionate about empowering end-users with tools and technologies that lead to an independent life. I like to keep learning and applying, thinking of myself as a sponge for absorbing new information. I like to mentor, volunteer, and meet new people. I have experience working with React, Electron, React Native, C#, .NET, and Python. 

## I would love to collaborate and get help on... ðŸ‘¯
Assistive Technology and Generative AI. I did some machine learning classes in college, however am looking to get deeper in the space to see how AI can be applied for the end-user. I am interested in keeping AI Integrations tightly coupled and private to the user, with little interest in selling data or training on user information.
